# ESP8266InternetRadio
Implements an Internet Radio operated by a single pushbutton.

 * Purpose      This program shows how to use the excellent ESP8266audio
 *              library from Earle F. Philhower. It is an adaptation of
 *              his example program "StreamMP3FromHTTP".
 *              Using a pusbutton, stations can be selected forward or
 *              backward from a list. A short click selects the next
 *              station, a long click the previous one. If the selected
 *              URL cannot be played, the next station is tried
 *              automatically. A doubleclick shows the currently played
 *              station. 
 * 
 *              ðŸ‘‰ For output no DAC like the Max98357, PCM5102 or 
 *                 VS1053B is needed.
 *                 If we use an external DAC we have to change the 
 *                 audio output class from AudioOutputI2SNoDAC to 
 *                 AudioOutputI2S, which we can achieve by defining
 *                 EXTERNAL_DAC (see line 81).

 * Speaker driver   I connected an 8 Î© / 0.5 W loudspeaker via a MOS-FET
 *                  driver, which I usually use as an output stage for
 *                  driving a motor or other loads. This is certainly
 *                  not the optimal solution for an audio output, but it
 *                  is sufficient for the experiment.
